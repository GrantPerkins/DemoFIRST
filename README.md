# Demo for FIRST Hour of Code

This is code for GearsBot and a raspberry pi vision system. It grabs a paper towel tube, lifts it, uses vision to steer as it drives over to a box, then once the vision says it is close enough, drops the tube, backs up until the vision says it is far enough away, then lowers the arn.
